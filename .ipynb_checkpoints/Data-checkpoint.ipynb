There will be three final columns: the name of the Rione, its latitude and its longitude.\n",
    "The <b>second</b> source is a Wikipedia page containing info about the number of residents, area (expressed in squared kilometers) and population density (expressed in number of people per squared kilometer) in each Rione. We will mantain all of these information for some final evaluations about the place chosen to install the accomodation business.\n",
    "The <b>third</b> and last piece of information will be gotten from Foursquare, by getting all the venues nearby our neighborhoods location in a 500 meters radius and with a limit of 100 venues. These info will comprise the individual venue's name, latitude and longitude, category."
